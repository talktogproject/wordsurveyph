# Participant Information Sheet
## TALKTOGETHER: Word Survey 

**INTRODUCTION**

We are researchers from The Promise Foundation. We are working on a research project about children’s language. This project is conducted by a team of experts from The Promise Foundation and the University of Oxford.  Our team is led by Dr. Sonali Nag, an Associate Professor of Education and the Developing Child in the Department of Education, University of Oxford and Dr. Gideon Arulmani, The Promise Foundation.

**WHY DID WE APPROACH YOU?** 

We want to understand how children develop their language skills in the different languages they know: Kannada, English, and other languages. For this we are studying children’s language at home and in school for three years. This year our research focuses on finding the best activities to measure language in children between 3 to 6 years old. 

You have been invited because you are a parent or a teacher who is fluent in Kannada.

**WHAT IS THE STUDY ABOUT?**

Language is important because it helps children become better at reading. Strong language also helps children to have good understanding of what they read in school. Even before children learn to read, we can already start preparing them by making them good at using language. Unfortunately, we don’t know a lot about how children learn languages when there are many languages around them. This project will help us understand how we can support children’s language in Kannada. It will help us create better lessons for children’s learning and better activities to check what they are learning. 

**WHAT WILL HAPPEN?** 

After you read this information sheet, you may ask any question that you may have about the project. If you still wish to participate, we will ask you to complete a consent form for the study, then schedule with you one session at a time convenient for you and through to your preferred mode of communication (e.g., landline, mobile, or online voice call services such as Whatsapp, Skype, Zoom, Microsoft Teams). 

In the pilot session, we will ask you to be in front of your computer with a working internet connection. We will send you a hyperlink to the pilot survey, which we will ask you to complete. The survey contains sets of words in Kannada. For each word, you will be asked to identify, according to what you think, the age of the child when they first understand the given word.  You will also be asked to identify, based on what you think, a person can visualize or picture in their mind the given word. We will ask you if you were able to access the survey, understand the questions, and submit your responses successfully. We will also answer any question that you may have at this time. 

We will send you a hyperlink to the session. We will be available to answer any questions that you may have while completing the survey. 

The session should take around 30 to 45 minutes. You can ask to pause or stop the session at any time.


**DATA & RESULTS** 

**What data will you collect?**

We will ask for your age, gender, your occupation, and your experience with 3-to-6 year-old children (e.g., number and ages of children for parent participants and years of teaching experience, subjects and grade levels taught for teacher participants). We are collecting this information to describe the participants of our survey. For the judgments you made for when each word is first understood, we will record the age-band. For judgments you made for whether a word is easy or difficult to visualise by a child, we will record this also.  


**What will happen to the data?** 

While the project is ongoing, we will enter all information in computer files and these will be stored with password protection in the Oxford University servers. Only members of the research team can access these. We want to compute the average of everyone’s judgments and share this with other researchers who want to know more about child language. The knowledge that we learn will be shared in scientific journals, presentations, and reports.  

We will only communicate with you using work e-mail accounts and project-specific mobile phone numbers. All e-mails and messages related to your participation in the study will be deleted in the last quarter of the TalkTogether project on October 2022.



**Will you use my name?** 

We will not use your name. We will create a unique number to connect all data that we collect about you. The list that will connect your name with the unique number will be kept secure and only members of the research team will be able to see it. This list will be deleted in the last quarter of the TalkTogether project on October 2022. 


**Will the study affect me?** 

You might get a little tired from answering the survey. We will make sure that you can take breaks whenever you want to. If there is any reason to worry, we will make sure that you are referred to the most appropriate expert to support you. You will not receive any compensation for participation but we will share what we learned with you in a simple report if you agree to provide your e-mail address for this purpose. We will need six months after we collect your answers to provide you with this report. 


**What next?** 

If you agree to participate, we will ask you to email to us a complete and signed [consent form](https://github.com/talktogproject/wordsurvey/raw/gh-pages/ConsentForm.doc). You may contact the following for any questions or concerns about the study:
