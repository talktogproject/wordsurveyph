# YOU ARE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN TALKTOGETHER
## Word Survey

TalkTogether is a research project conducted by experts from the University of Oxford and University of the Philippines. It aims to understand how children develop their language skills, including Filipino, English, and the mother tongues. 

We are looking for parents, teachers, or local language experts to participate in an online Filipino language survey. We will set up one practice session and around four survey sessions at times that are convenient for you. Each session would take about 30 to 45 minutes of your time. We will give you sets of words in Filipino. For each word you will tell us when you think they are first understood by children. We will also ask you to tell us how easy or difficult it is to visualize or make a picture of the word in our mind. Sometimes, if we are unable to finish, we will set up further sessions with you.
